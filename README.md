# Sebastian Naranjo — Portfolio

## Who I Am
Machine learning engineer with a Ph.D. in applied mathematics and deep experience building data-driven systems in high-noise, low-sample environments. I have delivered multimodal agents, refactored retrieval-augmented pipelines, and shipped surrogate models for manufacturing, ecommerce, and scientific simulations. My background includes a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Milan-Bicocca, a mathematics Ph.D. from Oregon State University (minor in Risk & Uncertainty Quantification), and multiple internships at Los Alamos National Laboratory where I built advanced simulation tooling.

## Stack & Focus Areas
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, C++
- **ML / AI**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, DSPy, Pipecat
- **Cloud & Ops**: Docker, FastAPI, MLflow, Ray Tune, GitHub Actions
- **Domains**: Manufacturing process optimization, ecommerce analytics, retrieval-augmented generation, PDE simulation, surrogate modeling
- **Collaboration**: Technical writing, presenting research, mentoring analytical workflows, organizing symposiums
