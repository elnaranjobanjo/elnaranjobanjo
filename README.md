# Sebastian Naranjo — Portfolio

## Who I Am
Machine learning engineer with a Ph.D. in applied mathematics and deep experience building data-driven systems end to end. I’ve led multimodal agent work at Nedu AI, delivered manufacturing surrogates at Sandbox Semiconductor, consulted on ecommerce analytics at Cuesta Partners, and built advanced simulation tooling during multiple Los Alamos National Lab internships. Academically, I completed a mathematics Ph.D. at Oregon State University (minor in Risk & Uncertainty Quantification) followed by a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Milan-Bicocca.

## Stack & Focus Areas
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, C++
- **ML / AI**: PyTorch, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, DSPy, Pipecat, Ray Tune
- **Cloud & Ops**: Docker, FastAPI, MLflow, GitHub Actions
- **Domains**: Manufacturing process optimization, ecommerce analytics, retrieval-augmented generation, PDE simulation, surrogate modeling
- **Collaboration**: Technical writing, presenting research, mentoring analytical workflows

## Cloud Certifications
- AWS Certified Machine Learning Engineer (MLA-C01), 2025–2028
- AWS Certified AI Practitioner (AIF-C01), 2025–2028
